def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()


Intermediate Python Questions

4. Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.

Answer: The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This means only one thread executes Python code at a time, which can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound and multithreaded code.


5. What is a lambda function?

Answer: A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5


6. How does memory management work in Python?

Answer: Python uses a private heap to manage memory. The memory manager in Python handles allocation and deallocation of heap space for Python objects. Python also has built-in garbage collection to reclaim unused memory, using reference counting and cyclic garbage collector.

7. What is the difference between deepcopy and copy in Python?

Answer: copy.copy() creates a shallow copy of an object, while copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy. A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. A deep copy constructs a new compound object and, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Advanced Python Questions:

8. What are Python's data structures?

Answer: Python includes several built-in data structures:
Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of objects.
Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections of objects.
Sets: Unordered collections of unique objects.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs

9. Explain list comprehensions and provide an example.

Answer: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

Example:

squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

10. What are generators in Python?

Answer: Generators are iterators that produce items one at a time and only when required, using the yield statement. 

def generate_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i

for number in generate_numbers():
    print(number)
	
11. How do you handle exceptions in Python?

Answer: Exceptions in Python are handled using try and except blocks. Example:

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

12. What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python?

Answer: __str__ is used for creating a string representation of an object for end users, while __repr__ is used for creating an official string representation of an object, mainly for developers. Ideally, __repr__ should be unambiguous and __str__ should be readable.

13. Explain the use of the with statement in Python.

Answer: The with statement is used for resource management and exception handling. It ensures that resources are properly released when the block is exited.

14. What is monkey patching in Python?

Answer: Monkey patching refers to modifying or extending the behavior of libraries or classes at runtime.

	threading for threads.
	multiprocessing for processes.
	asyncio for asynchronous I/O operations.
	
26. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Python.

Answer: 
Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, blocking the execution until the current task is completed. 
Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, using async and await keywords to manage execution without blocking.

27. What is the significance of the __init__.py file in a Python package?

Answer: The __init__.py file indicates that the directory it resides in is a Python package. 
It can be an empty file or execute initialization code for the package

28. How is memory managed in Python?
Answer:
Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.
The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.
The Python garbage collector (GC) handles the deallocation of memory by using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector for detecting and collecting reference cycles.

29. Differentiate between deep copy and shallow copy.
Answer:

Shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
Deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds copies of nested objects found in the original.

30. Explain list comprehension and provide an example.

Answers:
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]


31. How does Python's exception handling work?

Answer:

Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions.
try block contains code that may throw an exception.
except block contains code that handles the exception.
else block runs if no exceptions are raised.
finally block runs whether an exception is raised or not, typically used for cleanup.

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero!")
else:
    print("No exceptions!")
finally:
    print("This always runs.")

32. How can you optimize Python code for better performance?

Answer:
Use efficient data structures (e.g., set and dict instead of list for membership checks).
Avoid using global variables.
Use built-in functions and libraries.
Write performance-critical parts in C/C++.
Use list comprehensions and generator expressions.
Profile your code to identify bottlenecks.

33. What is a lambda function in Python?


Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword.

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5


34. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?

Answer:

@staticmethod: Defines a method that does not receive an implicit first argument (no self or cls), behaves like a plain function but belongs to the class’s namespace.
@classmethod: Defines a method that receives the class as its first argument (cls). It can modify class state that applies across all instances.

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static method")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("Class method")

MyClass.static_method()
MyClass.class_method()



35. How do you manage packages in Python?

Answer:

Use pip for installing and managing Python packages.
Use virtual environments (venv) to create isolated environments for dependencies.

36. What is the use of the with statement in Python?

The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks.
It ensures resources are properly managed, such as file streams.

with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()

37.  What is the difference between is and == in Python?
Answer:

is: Checks for object identity (whether both are the same object).
==: Checks for value equality (whether both have the same value).

38. What is the purpose of the pass statement?
Answer:
The pass statement is a null operation used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

def empty_function():
    pass
39. How do you serialize and deserialize objects in Python?

Answer:
Use the pickle module for serializing (pickling) and deserializing (unpickling) objects.

import pickle

data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
serialized = pickle.dumps(data)
deserialized = pickle.loads(serialized)

40. What are Python's data hiding and name mangling features?

Data hiding can be achieved by prefixing the attribute name with an underscore (_) or double underscore (__) for name mangling.

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected = "protected"
        self.__private = "private"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected)
# print(obj.__private)  # AttributeError
print(obj._MyClass__private


41. How do you perform unit testing in Python?

Use the unittest module for creating and running tests.
import unittest

class TestStringMethods(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_upper(self):
        self.assertEqual('foo'.upper(), 'FOO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

42. Explain the difference between del and remove() methods.

Answer:

del removes an item from a list or a dictionary by index or key.
remove() removes the first occurrence of a value from a list.

43. What is a Python namespace?

A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (variable names) and ensures that names are unique and can be used without conflict.
