Running the Maven commands release:prepare and release:perform are crucial steps in the Maven release process, ensuring your project is ready for release and then performing the release. Here’s a high-level overview of each step:

Step 1: mvn release:prepare
The mvn release:prepare command prepares your project for release by performing the following actions:

Checks for SNAPSHOT Versions: Ensures that no SNAPSHOT dependencies are present in the project POM.
Updates the POM Version: Changes the version in the POM file from a SNAPSHOT version to a release version.
Commits the Changes: Commits the modified POM file and other changes to the SCM (Source Control Management) system.
Tags the SCM: Tags the project in the SCM with the release version for future reference.
Updates to Next Development Version: Updates the POM to a new SNAPSHOT version for the next development cycle and commits this change.
To run this command, navigate to the root directory of your Maven project and execute:

sh
Copy code
mvn release:prepare
Step 2: mvn release:perform
The mvn release:perform command performs the actual release by:

Checks Out the Tagged Version: Checks out the version tagged during the release:prepare phase from the SCM.
Builds the Project: Builds the project from the checked-out tag.
Deploys the Artifacts: Deploys the built artifacts to the configured remote repository (e.g., Maven Central, Nexus, Artifactory).
To run this command, execute:

sh
Copy code
mvn release:perform
Detailed Execution Steps
Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for executing these commands:

Ensure the Project is in a Clean State:

Make sure all changes are committed.
Ensure the project builds successfully with mvn clean install.
Run release:prepare:

Execute mvn release:prepare in the terminal.
Follow the prompts to specify the release version, tag name, and the next development version.
Run release:perform:

After release:prepare completes successfully, execute mvn release:perform.
This will check out the tagged version, build it, and deploy the artifacts.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
SCM Configuration: Ensure that your SCM (e.g., Git) is correctly configured in your pom.xml.
Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to commit changes and create tags in the SCM.
Remote Repository Configuration: Ensure your remote repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) is correctly configured in your pom.xml and settings.xml.
By following these steps, you can successfully prepare and perform a release using Maven.
