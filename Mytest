Proposed Standards for MY-appp Enhancement

1. **Build and Compatibility**:
   - Migrate from Ant to Maven, compatible with JDK 8.

2. **CI/CD Implementation**:
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated build and deployment.

3. **Security and Secrets Management**:
   - Integrate with vault/secrets for sensitive information management.

4. **Code Governance**:
   - Enforce PR review process to restrict direct pushes to main branch.

5. **Logging Standardization**:
   - Implement x-minoting for centralized logging.

6. **Artifact Management**:
   - Automate artifact deployment using GitHub Actions.

7. **Documentation and Insights**:
   - Include readme file in each repository for clear insights.

These standards aim to modernize MY-appp's development practices, enhance security, and improve overall efficiency and collaboration within the development team.
